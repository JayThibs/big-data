    "When I say 'popular', I don't mean popular among comic readers. What we are defining as popularity is that how many times a certain character appears in another superhero's comic. We'll imagine that if, for example, spiderman appears in a comic with Captain America, that means they are friends. So, the superhero with the most friends (appears with the most other superheroes) will be considered the most 'popular'.\n",
